## Projects

### Banking System
A simplified banking domain model supporting customer registration and account management. The system implements personal and corporate accounts and supports operations such as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.

Focus areas:
- Domain modeling
- Business logic implementation
- Object-oriented design

---

### News Broadcasting System (Observer Pattern)
An event-driven news distribution system implementing the Observer design pattern. The system allows observers to subscribe and automatically receive updates when news is published.

Focus areas:
- Observer design pattern
- Event-driven architecture
- Interface-based design

---

### Book Management System (Composite Pattern)
A hierarchical book management system using the Composite design pattern. The system allows individual books and collections of books to be handled uniformly.

Focus areas:
- Composite design pattern
- Recursive hierarchical structures
- Polymorphism and abstraction

---

### UML Software Design
A collection of UML diagrams created to model software systems and domain relationships. These diagrams demonstrate structured software design and architecture planning before implementation.

Focus areas:
- Class diagram modeling
- Interface and inheritance relationships
- Software architecture documentation

---

### Observer System Unit Testing
A set of automated tests verifying the functionality of the Observer-based news broadcasting system.

Focus areas:
- Unit testing with JUnit 5
- Exception testing
- Testing event-driven system behavior

---

### Minesweeper Game
An implementation of the classic Minesweeper game focusing on grid-based logic and recursive tile reveal algorithms.

Focus areas:
- Grid-based data structures
- Recursive algorithms
- Interactive application logic

---

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Maven
- JUnit 5
- Git
