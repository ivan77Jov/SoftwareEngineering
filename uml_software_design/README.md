# UML Software Design Diagrams

## Overview
This folder contains UML diagrams created as part of the *Software Engineering* course at the University of Salzburg. The diagrams model software systems and demonstrate structured software design and architecture planning.

The purpose of this assignment was to translate system requirements into visual models using standard UML notation.

---

## UML Concepts Demonstrated

The diagrams include:

- Class diagrams
- Object relationships
- Inheritance hierarchies
- Associations and multiplicities
- Enumeration modeling
- Interface implementation

---

## Contents

### Media Management System (Part A)
A domain model representing a media lending system including:

- Users borrowing and reserving media
- Media hierarchy (Book, Journal, CD, DVD)
- Copy management with status tracking
- Grouping of media copies

---

### Account Management System (Part C)
A system modeling account and identity relationships including:

- Interface-based architecture
- Account inheritance hierarchy
- Manager class responsible for system elements
- University-linked student accounts

---

## Purpose

These diagrams demonstrate how software systems can be designed before implementation. UML modeling supports:

- Clear communication of system structure
- Early validation of software design
- Improved understanding of domain relationships
- Better architecture planning

---

## Learning Outcomes

Through this assignment, I gained experience in:

- Translating requirements into UML models
- Designing object-oriented class hierarchies
- Modeling system relationships and responsibilities
- Applying standard UML notation
- Documenting software architecture visually

---

## Tools Used

- UML diagramming tools (e.g., draw.io / similar UML modeling tools)
- Standard UML notation

---

## Context

Developed as coursework for the *Software Engineering* course at the University of Salzburg.
