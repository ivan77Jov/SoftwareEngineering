## Projects

### Banking System
A simplified banking domain model supporting customer registration, personal and corporate account management, and financial operations such as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.

Key concepts demonstrated:
- Domain modeling
- Object-oriented design
- Business rule enforcement
- Use of Java collections and `BigDecimal` for financial calculations

### Observer Pattern – News Broadcasting System
An event-driven news distribution system implementing the Observer design pattern. The system allows dynamic subscription and notification of observers when news content is published.

Key concepts demonstrated:
- Observer design pattern
- Interface-based architecture
- Event-driven system design
- Decoupled communication between components

### Composite Pattern – Book Management System
A hierarchical book management system using the Composite design pattern. The system allows individual books and nested collections of books to be treated uniformly.

Key concepts demonstrated:
- Composite design pattern
- Recursive hierarchical structures
- Polymorphism and abstraction
- Extensible object-oriented modeling

### UML Software Design Diagrams
A collection of UML diagrams modeling software systems and domain relationships. These diagrams demonstrate structured design planning and architecture modeling prior to implementation.

Key concepts demonstrated:
- Class diagram modeling
- Interface and inheritance relationships
- Multiplicity and association modeling
- Visual software architecture documentation

### Observer Pattern Unit Testing
Automated unit tests verifying the functionality of the Observer-based news broadcasting system. The test suite focuses on event notification, authentication logic, and content moderation behavior.

Key concepts demonstrated:
- Unit testing using JUnit 5
- Exception testing
- Behavioral testing of event-driven systems
- Use of mock observers and test setup strategies

### Minesweeper Game
An implementation of the classic Minesweeper game focusing on grid-based game logic, recursive tile revealing algorithms, and interactive state management.

Key concepts demonstrated:
- Grid-based data structures
- Recursive algorithms
- State management
- Application-level object-oriented design
